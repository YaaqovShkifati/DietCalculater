# DietCalculater
 * Description: In this program, we are creating a calculator that
 * would measure how much the Basal Metabolic Rate(BMR) and the Total Energy
 * Expenditure(TEE). BMR is the total amount of calories that is burnt when a
 * person is asleep and the TEE is the total amount that will approximate
 * physical activity. Our objective in this program is to create a diet
 * calculator that would measure the BMR; by entering the gender, height in feet
 * and inches, age in years, weight in pounds. However, the BMR formula is in
 * measures of the metric- system, so would need first to write a method that
 * would convert weight from pounds to kilograms(kg) and other method from feet
 * and inches to centimeters (cm). Then will write another two methods that
 * would calculate the formulas for BMR and TEE. When writing method TEE we will
 * need to use if statements that would set the conditions of the person
 * activity levels. We are measuring the persons activity level by 3 sets; 1 is
 * light activity (BMR * 1.53), 2 is moderately active (BMR * 1.76), and 3
 * vigorously active (BMR * 2.25). The results would give us the total amount of
 * daily calories person burnt given the conditions of the BMR and TEE.
 *
 * I have chosen to use the trailer method to write this program. This method is
 * effective when you use the a method name while. While is a type of loop which
 * does repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is
 * true. I have chosen my condition if gender equals the character 'M' which
 * represents male or if character 'F' represents female or when gender does not
 * equal to character 'X' to exit the loop.
 *
 * The most difficult part when writing this program for me was choosing the
 * best way to structure this program. There are soo many different ways in fact
 * i wrote it in two different ways with both resulting the correct output. The
 * first version i had everything read and printed out in my main method inside
 * the while loop but, i realized that main was way too big. What i did in the
 * second version i just printed the out the results at the end of each method.
 * Which gave the same results it just looked a lot better with the main not
 * being soo compacted. For my personal opinion i prefer programs that are more
 * science related programs because not only my skills in programing would
 * improve but, also educates me on that topic.
